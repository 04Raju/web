			</div>
			<div class='contents'>
				<p>Since I started my Bachelor's program (Software Engineering at uWaterloo), I've begun to realise that engineers... don't have it easy in university. Engineers in university are not allowed to have lives, mostly because they're too busy doing homework and studying.</p>
				<p>Now, not to say that engineering is the most difficult program (it is), but it's definitely right up there with the worst of the lot.</p>
				<p>To help me keep my sanity with the horror of upper-year courses appraoching, I've made myself a handy chart with all of my required courses, pre-requisites, and the electives I currently assume I'll be taking (subject to change).</p>
				<p>Admittedly, the electives will be completely useless for virtually everyone except myself, but the rest of the chart should be useful for anyone taking software engineering at Waterloo. Yes, I do mean all 150 of you. Enjoy!</p>
