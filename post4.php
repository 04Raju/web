				<p>I'm currently about one week away from finishing my first year at university. I'm about halfway though my exams, and will soon see whether I made it through my first year.</p>
				<p>The first thing I noticed about university was the exponential rise in difficulty after the first term. My first term was easy enough: most of the material was review, homework could be completed in an hour or two, and I didn't have to put a lot of effort into studying. It was pretty much like an Indian action movie.</p>

				<p>Then second term started. Oh boy, second term. Suddenly, everything was different: the first half of the year was filled with slightly harder material which built on stuff I already knew or, in some cases, was still review (but just barely). Midterms came and went, and with them the last of the pre-learned material, and suddenly everything became difficult. Classes that were easy before midterms (MATH 135: If a -> b and b -> c, prove a -> c), jumped in difficulty by a fair amount (ECE 106: Given the following region of charge density p and the population density of Toronto, calculate the energy of the sun).</p>

				<p>On the plus side, I've been (by necessity) slowly learning how to properly study, which is a skill I didn't gain in high school. Hopefully given my newfound knowledge, my exams will turn out better than this guy's magic trick.</p>
