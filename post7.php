				<p>So all of my classmates posted on our Facebook group that our end-of-term marks are out. My heart stops for a moment. This is it, the moment of truth. What I see on the school website will determine whether I passed or failed, whether I win or lose, whether I... hold on. I can't access the site in Chromium. Ah, that's OK, I'll use IE or Firefox or Safari or... huh, these aren't working.</p>
				<p>No problem, I've got an Android with wifi. I'll just... huh, that's weird. Not in Chrome either? Well then... I'm in a hotel, why don't I just go use the lobby PCs?</p>
				<p>Run down to the elevator, now feeling quite anxious, get to one of the PCs, open up Firefox... nope. I hope none of the guests heard my frustrated scream.</p>
				<p>Return to my room. Sitting here, morosely and deliciously angsty, wondering whether or not I passed this term... and whether I'll ever know.</p>
