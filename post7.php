				<p>So all of my classmates posted on our SE2017 Facebook group that our end-of-term marks are out. I went to check the school website, and... I can't access it. In despair, I tried a different browser. Nope.</p>
				<p>With anxiety, I went down to the lobby, to use a public PC (I'm in a hotel, at the moment). Nope. Tried every browser there is on that PC. Nope.</p>
				<p>I tried it on my cell phone. Still no.</p>
				<p>So, know I'm sitting here, feeling deliciously angsty, as I wonder whether I passed this term... and whether I'll ever know.</p>
