==============================================  ======================================  ===========
`A Bluer Shade of White`_                       FanFic(Frozen), RatFic                  The story of a post-Frozen Elsa using her powers to rule and improve the country. Short, good read.
`Animorphs\: The Reckoning`_                    FanFic(Animorphs), RatFic, ONGOING      A fantastically written re-telling of the Animorphs. Wonderful story, would highly recommend.
`Branches on the Tree of Time`_                 FanFic(Terminator), RatFic              THE Terminator rational re-write. Excellelently written, fantastic use of time travel, definitely worth reading.
`Friendship is Optimal`_                        FanFic(MLP), RatFic                     The MLP RatFic which spawned any others. Well-written and interesting take, but I've never really been able to get into the MLP fandom even for adjacent material like this. Worth a read, especially if you feel differently.
`Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality`_  FanFic(HP), RatFic                      The story which defined the RatFic genre. Read this.
`Harry Potter and the Natural 20`_              FanFic(HP)/FanFic(D&D), Humor, ONGOING  Silly cross-over crackfic where a D&&D character is dropped in to the HP universe. Quite funny. Went on a long hiatus after book two, but has recently been picked up again.
`Kaleidoscope`_                                 FanFic(Naruto), SI                      The author is born into the Uchiha family before the massacre. A frantic struggle to survive ensues. Enjoyable read, bit of a power-up fantasy.
`Luminosity`_                                   FanFic(Twilight), RatFic                What if Bella was not an idiot? Well written, interesting story, highly acclaimed on `/r/rational`_. Personally, though, I've picked up and abandoned this a couple times now but can't quite put my finger on why. My current best guess is timing -- someday soon I'll set aside the time to read this in one go and see if that changes things.
`Mother of Learning`_                           Fantasy, RatFic, ONGOING                Interesting time loop story about a wizard. The catch? Its not his time-loop and he's completely out of his depth. Very well-written story with well-managed power creep and interesting twists and turns. Disclaimer: still in-progress, but nearing completion.
`Pokemon\: The Origin of Species`_              FanFic(Pokemon), RatFic, ONGOING        Red as a professor-in-training. Lovely re-imagining of the universe, worth a read.
`Professor Arc`_                                FanFic(RWBY), Humor                     Jaune Arc finds he faked his credentials so well that he is offered a teaching position. Hilarity ensues. Well-written and very funny read, definitely worth checking out.
`Ra`_                                           Fantasy, RatFic                         Magic as Engineering. Very well-written, worth checking out.
`Shadows of the Limelight`_                     Superheroes, RatFic                     A story about superheroes whose powers are defined by stories. Very interesting take on the genre, worth a read.
`The Bridge`_                                   SciFi                                   Interesting story about life on a colony ship hundreds of years after understanding of our own technology has been lost. Very interesting, definitely worth a read.
`The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant`_               RatFic                                  Hard to describe without giving the story away -- very short read, "makes you think". Check it out!
`The Last Christmas`_                           RatFic                                  Short story about the mantle of Santa Claus being passed down to an industrial engineer. Short story, interesting read.
`The Metropolitan Man`_                         FanFic(Superman), RatFic                Fantastically written story which pits Lex Luther as the villain protagonist to a newly arrived alien God. Highly recommended.
`The Two Year Emperor`_                         FanFic(D&D), RatFic                     A guy gets thrown into a D&D universe to act as the emperor of a country. Fun, munchkin-ey story.
`The Waves Arisen`_                             FanFic(Naruto), Rational                What if Naruto grew up smart and curious? A defining work of the RatFic genre, absolutely worth a read.
`Threadbare`_                                   LitRPG                                  A cute story about a teddy-bear who gains sentience in a LitRPG world. Very light-hearted, fun read.
`Three Worlds Collide`_                         SciFi, RatFic                           Short and highly recommended. "The kind of classic fifties-era first-contact story that Jonathan Swift might have written, if Jonathan Swift had had a background in game theory." -Peter Watts
`Time Braid`_                                   FanFic(Naruto), RatFic                  Time-looping power-creep crackfic with some occasional fucked up subject matter. That said, it somehow manages to be a great read despite the previous sentence.
`When In Doubt, Obliviate`_                     FanFic(HP), Humor                       Silly little story about HP being raised by Gilderoy Lockhart. Short read, good for a few giggles.
`Worm`_                                         Superheroes, RatFic                     One of, if not the, best web serials I've ever read. Could not recommend more highly. Warning: incredibly long. Like, seriously long. As long as the entire "A Song of Ice and Fire" series -- and that's ignoring Worm's recently-published interlude and in-progress follow-up sequel.
`Worth the Candle`_                             LitRPG, SI, ONGOING                     A GM gets thrown into a fantasy world of his own creation. Interesting and fun read.
