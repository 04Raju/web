==============================================  ======================================  ===========
`A Bluer Shade of White`_                       FanFic(Frozen), RatFic                  The story of a post-Frozen Elsa using her powers to rule and improve the country. Short, good read.
`Branches on the Tree of Time`_                 FanFic(Terminator), RatFic              THE Terminator rational re-write. Excellelently written, fantastic use of time travel, definitely worth reading.
`Break Them All`_                               SI                                      The prequel to `Heromaker\'s Legacy`_, a Worm fanfic, this is a story about exploring and learning a magic system. Interesting power growth story about applying real-world ideas to munchkining a magic system, but unfortunately the goal of this story is just to support Heromaker's Legacy, which I didn't really enjoy, rather than to exist in its own right. Interesting, but unsatisfyingly unfinished.
`Death By Water`_                               FanFic(HP)xFanFic(Culture)              Harry Potter raised by The Culture. Interesting to see how the Culture universe interacts with a planet of magic, but not overly compelling. Seems to be abandoned.
`Dungeon Keeper Ami`_                           FanFic(Sailor Moon), LitRPG             A "Dungeon Core" LitRPG featuring Sailor Mercury. I was initially interested in this story for the interesting take on "good guy forced to be evil", but the MC's constant poor decision making and naivete eventually got on my nerves. Unfortunately, it felt like the story fell into a loop of the protagonist thinking "what could go wrong? I know everything about this thing I know nothing about, this can't go badly" then that thing going badly.
`Friendship is Optimal`_                        FanFic(MLP), RatFic                     The MLP RatFic which spawned any others. Well-written and interesting take, but I've never really been able to get into the MLP fandom even for adjacent material like this. Worth a read, especially if you feel differently.
`Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality`_  FanFic(HP), RatFic                      The story which defined the RatFic genre. Read this.
`Kaleidoscope`_                                 FanFic(Naruto), SI                      The author is born into the Uchiha family before the massacre. A frantic struggle to survive ensues. Enjoyable read, bit of a power-up fantasy.
`Luminosity`_                                   FanFic(Twilight), RatFic                What if Bella was not an idiot? Well written, interesting story, highly acclaimed on `/r/rational`_. Personally, though, I've picked up and abandoned this a couple times now but can't quite put my finger on why. My current best guess is timing -- someday soon I'll set aside the time to read this in one go and see if that changes things.
`Pact`_                                         Fantasy                                 The protagonist finds himself inheriting an old property with a trove of supernatural knowledge -- magic and demons ensue. Wonderfully written (same author as Worm), but I could never really get into the flow of the story. I've been informed that this one is much better reading in its entirety rather than trying to keep up week-by-week, so I'll likely try again at some point.
`Professor Arc`_                                FanFic(RWBY), Humor                     Jaune Arc finds he faked his credentials so well that he is offered a teaching position. Hilarity ensues. Well-written and very funny read, definitely worth checking out.
`Ra`_                                           Fantasy, RatFic                         Magic as Engineering. Very well-written, worth checking out.
`Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies`_          FanFic(Naruto), Humor                   A parody of Naruto, with a focus on absurdity and self-delusion. Fun and silly read.
`Shadows of the Limelight`_                     Superheroes, RatFic                     A story about superheroes whose powers are defined by stories. Very interesting take on the genre, worth a read.
`The Bridge`_                                   SciFi                                   Interesting story about life on a colony ship hundreds of years after understanding of our own technology has been lost. Very interesting, definitely worth a read.
`The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant`_               RatFic                                  Hard to describe without giving the story away -- very short read, "makes you think". Check it out!
`The Last Christmas`_                           RatFic                                  Short story about the mantle of Santa Claus being passed down to an industrial engineer. Short story, interesting read.
`The Metropolitan Man`_                         FanFic(Superman), RatFic                Fantastically written story which pits Lex Luther as the villain protagonist to a newly arrived alien God. Highly recommended.
`The Truth of the Sith`_                        FanFic(Star Wars), RatFic               A five-minute read -- Palpatine tells Anakin a story about the force. Very interesting take on the Force / Dark Side / Light Side / etc.
`The Two Year Emperor`_                         FanFic(D&D), RatFic                     A guy gets thrown into a D&D universe to act as the emperor of a country. Fun, munchkin-ey story.
`The Waves Arisen`_                             FanFic(Naruto), Rational                What if Naruto grew up smart and curious? A defining work of the RatFic genre, absolutely worth a read.
`Threadbare`_                                   LitRPG                                  A cute story about a teddy-bear who gains sentience in a LitRPG world. Very light-hearted, fun read.
`Three Worlds Collide`_                         SciFi, RatFic                           Short and highly recommended. "The kind of classic fifties-era first-contact story that Jonathan Swift might have written, if Jonathan Swift had had a background in game theory." -Peter Watts
`Time Braid`_                                   FanFic(Naruto), RatFic                  Time-looping power-creep crackfic with some occasional fucked up subject matter. That said, it somehow manages to be a great read despite the previous sentence.
`Unriddle the Riddle`_                          FanFic(HPMOR)                           A recursive fanfic alternate ending for HPMOR: "What if Harry allied with the Professor?". Meh.
`When In Doubt, Obliviate`_                     FanFic(HP), Humor                       Silly little story about HP being raised by Gilderoy Lockhart. Short read, good for a few giggles.
`Worm`_                                         Superheroes, RatFic                     One of, if not the, best web serials I've ever read. Could not recommend more highly. Warning: incredibly long. Like, seriously long. As long as the entire "A Song of Ice and Fire" series -- and that's ignoring Worm's recently-published interlude and in-progress follow-up sequel.

==============================================  ======================================  ===========
`Animorphs\: The Reckoning`_                    FanFic(Animorphs), RatFic               A fantastically written re-telling of the Animorphs. Wonderful story, would highly recommend.
`Harry Potter and the Natural 20`_              FanFic(HP)xFanFic(D&D), Humor           Silly cross-over crackfic where a D&&D character is dropped in to the HP universe. Quite funny. Went on a long hiatus after book two, but has recently been picked up again.
`Mother of Learning`_                           Fantasy, RatFic                         Interesting time loop story about a wizard. The catch? Its not his time-loop and he's completely out of his depth. Very well-written story with well-managed power creep and interesting twists and turns. Disclaimer: still in-progress, but nearing completion.
`Pokemon\: The Origin of Species`_              FanFic(Pokemon), RatFic                 Red as a professor-in-training. Lovely re-imagining of the universe, worth a read.
`Worth the Candle`_                             LitRPG, SI                              A GM gets thrown into a fantasy world of his own creation. Interesting and fun read.
