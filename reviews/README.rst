Title                                           Tags                                    Description
==============================================  ======================================  ===========
`Animorphs\: The Reckoning`_                    FanFic(Animorphs), RatFic               A fantastically written re-telling of the Animorphs. Wonderful story, would highly recommend.
`Harry Potter and the Natural 20`_              FanFic(HPxD&D), Humor                   Silly cross-over crackfic where a D&&D character is dropped in to the HP universe. Quite funny. Went on a long hiatus after book two, but has recently been picked up again.
`Mother of Learning`_                           Fantasy, RatFic                         Interesting time loop story about a wizard. The catch? Its not his time-loop and he's completely out of his depth. Very well-written story with well-managed power creep and interesting twists and turns. Disclaimer: still in-progress, but nearing completion.
`Pokemon\: The Origin of Species`_              FanFic(Pokemon), RatFic                 Red as a professor-in-training. Lovely re-imagining of the universe, worth a read.
`Worth the Candle`_                             LitRPG, SI                              A GM gets thrown into a fantasy world of his own creation. Interesting and fun read.
