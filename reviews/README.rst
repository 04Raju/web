==============================================  ======================================  ===========
`A Bluer Shade of White`_                       FanFic(Frozen), RatFic                  The story of a post-Frozen Elsa using her powers to rule and improve the country. Short, good read.
`Aeromancer`_                                   Fantasy                                 What do I say about this one? Interesting setting, interesting characters, interesting plot, but... well, the story got interrupted extremely suddenly by the author finding religion and deciding he thus could not continue writing. I'd recommend this one only to folks who aren't put off by unfinished stories -- its a great read until that interuption!
`Ava's Demon`_                                  Comic, SciFi                            A gorgeously-drawn webcomic about a young girl haunted by a demon a thousand years into the future. Worth checking out just for the artwork; and the story is great too.
`Benefactor`_                                   Superheroes, SciFi                      To describe this one would not do it justice -- its short, its interesting, read it!
`Branches on the Tree of Time`_                 FanFic(Terminator), RatFic              THE Terminator rational re-write. Excellently written, fantastic use of time travel, definitely worth reading.
`Break Them All`_                               SI                                      The prequel to `Heromaker\'s Legacy`_, a Worm fanfic, this is a story about exploring and learning a magic system. Interesting power growth story about applying real-world ideas to munchkining a magic system, but unfortunately the goal of this story is just to support Heromaker's Legacy, which I didn't really enjoy, rather than to exist in its own right. Interesting, but unsatisfyingly unfinished.
`Broken Blades`_                                FanFic(RWBY)                            I couldn't remember why I'd stopped reading this one a while back, so I picked it up again. Note to self for future: the story is an interesting divergence-style fanfic with a good building beginning, but it seems to have been abandoned by the author before getting to the meat of the story. Irrelevant to the story, but if you do check it out: don't read the "author notes" at the end of each chapter. Personally, at least, I thought a good chunk of them devolved into condescending blurbs of "oh man, I put this subtle thing in my writing, but I bet none of you noticed" with reference to blatantly obvious plotlines.
`Bunkercore`_                                   LitRPG                                  Dungeon Core variation with an interesting setting and plot. The author wiped a good chunk of the online copy in favor of publishing to Amazon, but has indicated he'll be continuing the story online eventually. If you like the teaser chapters he left online, you'll like the rest of the work.
`Coding Machines`_                              SciFi                                   A horror novel for programmers. Very good.
`Death By Water`_                               FanFic(HPxCulture)                      Harry Potter raised by The Culture. Interesting to see how the Culture universe interacts with a planet of magic, but not overly compelling. Seems to be abandoned.
`Demon`_                                        Comic                                   A really good webcomic about a guy who makes the sudden realization that he's not just a guy.
`Dream Drive`_                                  LitRPG                                  A near-future LitRPG with an interesting protagnosit and interaction between game-world and real-world. The author posted this to a Erotic Writing site since it contains sexual eliments, but those don't feel like they're "the point of the story".
`Dungeon Keeper Ami`_                           FanFic(Sailor Moon), LitRPG             A "Dungeon Core" LitRPG featuring Sailor Mercury. I was initially interested in this story for the interesting take on "good guy forced to be evil", but the MC's constant poor decision making and naivete eventually got on my nerves. Unfortunately, it felt like the story fell into a loop of the protagonist thinking "what could go wrong? I know everything about this thing I know nothing about, this can't go badly" then that thing going badly.
`Fleep`_                                        Comic, RatFic                           Fleep is an interesting (short) comic about an insomniac figuring out who and where he is. Great read!
`Friendship is Optimal`_                        FanFic(MLP), RatFic                     The MLP RatFic which spawned any others. Well-written and interesting take, but I've never really been able to get into the MLP fandom even for adjacent material like this. Worth a read, especially if you feel differently.
`Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality`_  FanFic(HP), RatFic                      The story which defined the RatFic genre. Read this.
`Kaleidoscope`_                                 FanFic(Naruto), SI                      The author is born into the Uchiha family before the massacre. A frantic struggle to survive ensues. Enjoyable read, bit of a power-up fantasy.
`Luminosity`_                                   FanFic(Twilight), RatFic                What if Bella was not an idiot? Well written, interesting story, highly acclaimed on `/r/rational`_. Personally, though, I've picked up and abandoned this a couple times now but can't quite put my finger on why. My current best guess is timing -- someday soon I'll set aside the time to read this in one go and see if that changes things.
`On Being a Sith Lord`_                         FanFic(Star Wars)                       One-shot KotOR story about how the protag feels about finding out about her previously-amnesiac past (massive spoilers, obviously -- go play KotOR, its great!). Short but sweet, lots of interesting tidbits and fun character interactions.
`Pact`_                                         Fantasy                                 The protagonist finds himself inheriting an old property with a trove of supernatural knowledge -- magic and demons ensue. Wonderfully written (same author as Worm), but I could never really get into the flow of the story. I've been informed that this one is much better reading in its entirety rather than trying to keep up week-by-week, so I'll likely try again at some point.
`People Lie`_                                   FanFic(Naruto)                          Darker Naruto world, Naruto/Hinata/Sasuke focus with a darker, more cynical Naruto whose personality spreads to the others. Interestingly written, but abandoned with a couple short spin-offs which seemed to be attempts to resurrect it. Very gratuitous, decent enough read.
`Professor Arc`_                                FanFic(RWBY), Humor                     Jaune Arc finds he faked his credentials so well that he is offered a teaching position. Hilarity ensues. Well-written and very funny read, definitely worth checking out.
`Ra`_                                           Fantasy, RatFic                         Magic as Engineering. Very well-written, worth checking out. I've been meaning to re-read this.
`Ruthless`_                                     FanFic(HP)                              Harry Potter as a vicious little shit, fairly short read. There's some gratuitous oddities for sure, but it certainly scratches a certain kind of competence-porn itch. A decent read for how short it is, but its more of a drabble than a story.
`Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies`_          FanFic(Naruto), Humor                   A parody of Naruto, with a focus on absurdity and self-delusion. Fun and silly read.
`Shadows of the Limelight`_                     Superheroes, RatFic                     A story about superheroes whose powers are defined by stories. Very interesting take on the genre, worth a read.
`Team Anko`_                                    FanFic(Naruto), RatFic                  "Rationality meets Naruto", a re-write where Naruto and friends get Anko as a Jounin-sensei. From the author of `The Two Year Emperor`_, the writing style is fantastic and the story is great.
`The Arithmancer`_                              FanFic(HP)                              The Arithmancer, as well as its sequel(s?), follow a scientifically-minded Hermione as she munchkins her way through life. Its no HPMOR, but its definitely entertaining!
`The Bound Dungeon`_                            LitRPG                                  Decent "Dungeon Core" story with some interesting growth progression and an interesting setting. Promissing, but never really took off -- it felt like it was just hitting its stride when the author disappeared for a while and then eventually came back to say he didn't like how the story was going and abandoned it.
`The Bridge`_                                   SciFi                                   Interesting story about life on a colony ship hundreds of years after understanding of our own technology has been lost. Very interesting, definitely worth a read.
`The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant`_               RatFic                                  Hard to describe without giving the story away -- very short read, "makes you think". Check it out!
`The Gamer`_                                    LitRPG                                  Probably the first well-known LitRPG, or at least the one that I came across first. Not bad, but eventually starts to drag on and on. I lost interest fairly quickly, but I can't complain too much since it led me into the genre and other works I have greatly enjoyed.
`The Games We Play`_                            FanFic(RWBYxGamer), LitRPG              This was the first LitRPG I really got into after finding the premise of `The Gamer`_ interesting but the story and writing to not be compelling enough to hold my attention. The RWBY world and history is completely re-imagined in this one, since it spawned so early in RWBY's seasons that it ended up ahead of the plot, but I find the histories explained in this to be as interesting if not more than the original work. Very long, very good, and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel.
`The Last Christmas`_                           RatFic                                  Short story about the mantle of Santa Claus being passed down to an industrial engineer. Short story, interesting read.
`The Metropolitan Man`_                         FanFic(Superman), RatFic                Fantastically written story which pits Lex Luther as the villain protagonist to a newly arrived alien God. Highly recommended.
`The Secret Number`_                            Oddball                                 A short and hard-to-classify story. Vaguely SCPish, involves memetics. Awesome read!
`The Truth of the Sith`_                        FanFic(Star Wars), RatFic               A five-minute read -- Palpatine tells Anakin a story about the force. Very interesting take on the Force / Dark Side / Light Side / etc.
`The Two Year Emperor`_                         FanFic(D&D), RatFic                     A guy gets thrown into a D&D universe to act as the emperor of a country. Fun, munchkin-ey story.
`The Waves Arisen`_                             FanFic(Naruto), Rational                What if Naruto grew up smart and curious? A defining work of the RatFic genre, absolutely worth a read.
`Threadbare`_                                   LitRPG                                  A cute story about a teddy-bear who gains sentience in a LitRPG world. Very light-hearted, fun read.
`Three Worlds Collide`_                         SciFi, RatFic                           Short and highly recommended. "The kind of classic fifties-era first-contact story that Jonathan Swift might have written, if Jonathan Swift had had a background in game theory." -Peter Watts
`Time Braid`_                                   FanFic(Naruto), RatFic                  Time-looping power-creep crackfic with some occasional fucked up subject matter. That said, it somehow manages to be a great read despite the previous sentence.
`Unriddle the Riddle`_                          FanFic(HPMOR)                           A recursive fanfic alternate ending for HPMOR: "What if Harry allied with the Professor?". Meh.
`Vapors`_ (sequel: `Clarity`_)                  FanFic(Naruto), SI                      The sort of thing I consider a "SI done right" -- the protagonist doesn't start with mythical chosen-one powers, doesn't have game-breaking knowledge-from-outside, and has no encyclopediac knowledge of the source universe. Fantastic read all the way up to a couple chapters before the end, at which point there's a big cliched twist when the story could have just ended in a supremely satisfying way. The sequel is much shorter, deals with that twist, and has a satisfying ending of its own, but the story probably would have hung together better if that twist hadn't occured. All-in-all a great read, though, even with that issue.
`When In Doubt, Obliviate`_                     FanFic(HP), Humor                       Silly little story about HP being raised by Gilderoy Lockhart. Short read, good for a few giggles.
`Worm`_                                         Superheroes, RatFic                     One of, if not the, best web serials I've ever read. Could not recommend more highly. Warning: incredibly long. Like, seriously long. As long as the entire "A Song of Ice and Fire" series -- and that's ignoring Worm's recently-published interlude and in-progress follow-up sequel.

==============================================  ======================================  ===========
`Animorphs\: The Reckoning`_                    FanFic(Animorphs), RatFic               A fantastically written re-telling of the Animorphs. Wonderful story, would highly recommend.
`Harry Potter and the Natural 20`_              FanFic(HPxD&D), Humor                   Silly cross-over crackfic where a D&&D character is dropped in to the HP universe. Quite funny. Went on a long hiatus after book two, but has recently been picked up again.
`Mother of Learning`_                           Fantasy, RatFic                         Interesting time loop story about a wizard. The catch? Its not his time-loop and he's completely out of his depth. Very well-written story with well-managed power creep and interesting twists and turns. Disclaimer: still in-progress, but nearing completion.
`Pokemon\: The Origin of Species`_              FanFic(Pokemon), RatFic                 Red as a professor-in-training. Lovely re-imagining of the universe, worth a read.
`Worth the Candle`_                             LitRPG, SI                              A GM gets thrown into a fantasy world of his own creation. Interesting and fun read.
