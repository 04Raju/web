description: Divergence-style retelling with a competent Jaune.

I couldn't remember why I'd stopped reading this one a while back, so I picked
it up again. Note to self for future: the story is an interesting
divergence-style fanfic with a good building beginning, but it seems to have
been abandoned by the author before getting to the meat of the story.

Irrelevant to the story, but if you do check it out: don't read the "author
notes" at the end of each chapter. Personally, at least, I thought a good chunk
of them devolved into condescending blurbs of "oh man, I put this subtle thing
in my writing, but I bet none of you noticed" with reference to blatantly
obvious plotlines.
