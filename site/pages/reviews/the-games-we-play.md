description: Complete RWBY re-write in the LitRPG style.

This was the first LitRPG I really got into after finding the premise of
<a href='http://mangafox.me/manga/the_gamer/'>The Gamer</a> interesting but the
story and writing to not be compelling enough to hold my attention.

The RWBY world and history is completely re-imagined in this one since it
spawned so early in RWBY's seasons that it ended up ahead of the plot, but I
find the histories explained in this to be as interesting if not more so than
the original work.

Very long, very good, and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel.
