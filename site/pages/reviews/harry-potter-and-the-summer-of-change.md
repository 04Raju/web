description: Road-to-independence with help from Tonks.

Semi-gratuitous road-to-independence power fantasy. But, you know, sometimes
that's just what you're looking for as a way to shut off your brain. I wasn't
overly relaxes this week, so this story served as a good way to disconnect my
brain for a bit and just go along for the ride.

That said, wouldn't really recommend this or read it again. There are better
versions of this.
