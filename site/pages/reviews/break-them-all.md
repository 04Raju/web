description: Munchkining a magic system.

The prequel to
<a href='https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/heromakers-legacy-worm-au-original.7589/'>Heromaker's Legacy</a>,
a Worm fanfic, this is a story about exploring and learning a magic system.
Interesting power growth story about applying real-world ideas to munchkining a
magic system, but unfortunately the goal of this story is just to support
Heromaker's Legacy, which I didn't really enjoy, rather than to exist in its
own right. Interesting, but unsatisfyingly unfinished.
