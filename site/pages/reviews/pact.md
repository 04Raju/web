description: Thrust into the world of demons, magic, and the supernatural.

The protagonist finds himself inheriting an old property with a trove of
supernatural knowledge -- magic and demons ensue. Wonderfully written (same
author as <a href='https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/'>Worm</a>),
but I could never really get into the flow of the story. I've been informed
that this one is much better reading in its entirety rather than trying to keep
up week-by-week, so I'll likely try again at some point.
