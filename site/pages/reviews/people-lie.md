description: Darker Naruto world with a cynical outlook.

Darker Naruto world, Naruto/Hinata/Sasuke focus with a darker, more cynical
Naruto whose personality spreads to the others. Interestingly written, but
abandoned with a couple short spin-offs which seemed to be attempts to
resurrect it. Very gratuitous, decent enough read.
