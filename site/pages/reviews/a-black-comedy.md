description: Absolutely hilarious parody story.

Absolutely hilarious, with some admittedly heart-warming moments thrown in for
seasoning. After Harry and Sirius get thrown into an alternate dimension in a
much less grimdark world, its up to them to spread amusement, antagonism, and
all-around debauchery. Good thing that world's in good hands.

Well... don't expect this one to win any plot-related awards anytime soon, but
for a light-hearted comedy, it certainly had me giggling like a loon more than
I'm comfortable to admit.
