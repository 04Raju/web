description: A skelton detective and his teensage side-kick save the world.

Several of my friends have called this "hands down the best YA series ever
written". Personally, I don't think I'd go that far, but I must admit its one
of the better ones out there. The characters are well-written, the story is
gripping, and Derek Landy's writing continues to be extraordinary.

This is probably the only YA novel I've read where romance is handled in a
completely reasonable fashion -- upon the protagonist's realization that their
significant other is a flesh-eating vampire in a universe where vampires don't
have the chance for redemption, their response is not to pine after them
endlessly for several chapters trying to make it work despite the inevitable
fallout. The author gets a huge amount of bonus points for that.
