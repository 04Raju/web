description: Biting and Humourous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager

I'd been excited to read this one for a while, since I've been reading Rands'
[blog](http://randsinrepose.com/blog/) for ages, ever since I found "What to do
When You're Screwed" in "The Best Software Writing I" a couple years back.
Managing Humans did not disappoint and it brought with it a slew of aspects of
management to chew on and consider as I transition into more of a leadership
position.

I'm not sure the subtitle was overly accurate -- the tales didn't seem overly
biting or humorous to me -- but the solidly layed out explanations on
management and processes aimed at those from a bit more of a technical
background than tends to be the norm for management was certainly a great read.

I found myself setting the book down several times as I finished chapters to
give myself a few minutes to consider what I'd read.

I'll certainly need to track down Rands' other book ("Being Geek") as well as
catch up on his backlog of articles. Love his writing style and I definitely
feel like I got a lot out of this.
