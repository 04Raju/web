description: Naruto SI done right.

The sort of thing I consider a "SI done right" -- the protagonist doesn't start
with mythical "chosen one" powers, doesn't have game-breaking
knowledge-from-outside, and has no encyclopediac knowledge of the source
universe.

Fantastic read all the way up to a couple chapters before the end, at which
point there's a big cliched twist when the story could have just ended in a
supremely satisfying way. The sequel is much shorter, deals with that twist,
and has a satisfying ending of its own, but the story probably would have hung
together better if that twist hadn't occured. All-in-all a great read, though,
even with that issue.
