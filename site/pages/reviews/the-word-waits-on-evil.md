description: Protagonist gets body-swapped into a Lich Dread Lord.

An interesting premise -- the SI protagonist gets body-swapped into a Lich
Dread Lord of a fantasy realm. It had me going for a while, but I eventually
lost interest. It has a lot of good, but also some very dry digressions into
boring minutia.
