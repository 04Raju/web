description: Temporary dimensional travel from a grimdark AU to a happy one.

This one had a very cool premise -- our chosen ones from a war-torn universe
get punted from their universe to one with no such issues. Not much in the way
of plot, this one focuses on character interactions.

Lovely amount of dark humour in this one and all-in-all a neat little
well-written story. The portrayal of the main characters was fantastic in its
cynical outlook and their interactions with the less-cynical characters of the
other dimension felt spot-on.
