description: Cute comic about heroes, villans, and... Nimona.

This was a fun one. After I read this, the author removed the bulk of the story
from her site in favor of offering the comic for sale -- at some point I'll
probably get around to purchasing a copy for myself.

The drawing style improves heavily over time, so don't be put off by the early
chapters.
