description: The best web serial I've ever read.

One of, if not the, best web serials I've ever read. Could not recommend more
highly. Warning: incredibly long. Like, seriously long. As long as the entire
"A Song of Ice and Fire" series and then some -- and that's ignoring Worm's
recently-published interlude and in-progress follow-up sequel.
