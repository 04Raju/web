description: A low-tier mage grows into his powers after his sight is stolen.

What do I say about this one? Interesting setting, interesting characters,
interesting plot, but... well, the story got interrupted extremely suddenly by
the author finding religion and deciding he thus could not continue writing.
I'd recommend this one only to folks who aren't put off by unfinished stories
-- it's a great read until that interruption!
