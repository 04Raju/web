description: A fantasy universe in which entropy works in reverse.

My memory of this one is foggy, but even years (and years, and years! The novel
was written in 1984) later its premise is completely unique. I've never read
anything quite like it -- I don't remember finding the characters or plotline
particularly compelling, but the central premise was incredibly intriguing.
