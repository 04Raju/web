description: Dystopian-ish YA fantasy with an amazing plot.

This one's got it all: its a fantastically unique setting, the characters are
incredibly detailed and well-written, the plot is <i>wonderful</i>, and I
really have nothing poor to say about this one. It even manages to avoid most
of the YA cliches and traps!

This is a must-read, even if you're not much of a YA fan. Though it starts off
in a fairly standard fantasy-ish magic-ish place, it quickly plots its own
course. There's a very unique magic system, which is certainly interesting to
see explored, and its a breath of fresh air to see the characters attempt at
least the most obvious of "munchkining" rather than avoid using their magic for
anything outside the norm.

The distopian elements are interesting and well-handled. Its not <i>V for
Vendetta</i> level dystopia, it's a much less heavy-handed take. Classism
abounds and is a large focus of the plot, but it isn't taken to the gratuitous
extreme.
