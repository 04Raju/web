description: An action detective comic about librarians. Yeah.

I don't think I'm ever likely to read another action detective comic about
librarians, nor would I enjoy it as much. This comic is from the same author as
<a href='http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001'>Demon</a> and
<a href='http://www.shigabooks.com/fleep.php'>Fleep</a>, both of which I loved,
and this one does not disappoint. Not his best work, but still very
well-written.
