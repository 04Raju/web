description: A heartbroken Harry Potter descends into necromancy.

A fairly unique one: a young Harry Potter, broken to the Boy-Who-Lived and
heartbroken at his sister's death, begins a slow descent into necromancy to
bring her back.

Portions of this definitely felt like caricatures rather than reasonable
actions, but the overall story of a character driven to extremes by the death
of a loved one was a good one. The descent feels gutteral in a reasonable way,
and being along for the ride was quite the trip.

The ending was very well done. It felt like it ended exactly as it should have,
with all the proper twists and turns and successes and failures. The ending
followed the story: triumphant, dark, and bittersweet.
