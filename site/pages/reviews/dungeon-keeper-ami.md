description: Sailor Mercury as a Dungeon Core.

A "Dungeon Core" LitRPG featuring Sailor Mercury. I was initially interested in
this story for the interesting take on "good guy forced to be evil", but the
MC's constant poor decision making and naivete eventually got on my nerves.
Unfortunately, it felt like the story fell into a loop of the protagonist
thinking "what could go wrong? I know everything about this thing I know
nothing about, this can't go badly" then that thing going badly.
