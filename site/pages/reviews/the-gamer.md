description: The first LitRPG.

Probably the first well-known LitRPG, or at least the one that I came across
first. Not bad, but eventually starts to drag on and on. I lost interest fairly
quickly, but I can't complain too much since it led me into the genre and other
works I have greatly enjoyed.

Worth reading some of if only to get a sense for how the genre was founded.
