description: Bella, but competent.

What if Bella was not an idiot? Well written, interesting story, very highly
acclaimed on
<a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index'>/r/rational</a>.

Personally, though, I've picked up and abandoned this a couple times now but
can't quite put my finger on why. My current best guess is timing -- someday
soon I'll set aside the time to read this in one go and see if that changes
things.
