description: Prison break from a crumbling Azkaban.

This was a very interesting concept, one of those ones which is hard to talk
about in retrospect without ruining some plot points.

The setting is a rebel-leader Harry Potter making an escape from Azkaban but
the realities of the plot are so much more.
