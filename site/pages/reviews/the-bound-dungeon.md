description: Dungeon core story in a unique setting.

Decent "Dungeon Core" story with some interesting growth progression and an
interesting setting. Promising, but never really took off -- it felt like it
was just hitting its stride when the author disappeared for a while and then
eventually came back to say he didn't like how the story was going and
abandoned it.
