description: Slice-of-life after Snape adopts Harry.

This one as well as both of its sequels... were actually much better than I
thought they'd be. A nice little slice-of-life story that played out an
interesting drama.

There were several places along this three-part series that the novel(s) could
have ended in a completely satisfactorily ending, but oddly enough I didn't
feel like it dragged out by continuing past those points. Sure some parts
dragged more than others, but overall the story flowed naturally along.

I didn't care too much for the concept of the main premise (ie. Harry adopted
by Snape, their differences get sorted out), so probably wouldn't seek it out
in the future, but this story handled it well. A bunch of OCs, many very well
fleshed-out, and some whose stories I would have liked to read on their own.

All-in-all a well-done story. I'd love to read more by this author, but wasn't
able to track anything else down outside of his related-to-this-story
one-shots.
