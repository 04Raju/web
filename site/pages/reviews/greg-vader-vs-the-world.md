description: A gamer in the Worm universe.

I <i>wanted</i> to like this one, but... man. This one just wasn't good. Maybe
I didn't give it enough of a chance, but I do not see how it got the ratings it
has. Maybe 4.x stars on RoyalRoad doesn't mean as much as I hoped it would? The
first time I've abandoned reading something so early in several months.
