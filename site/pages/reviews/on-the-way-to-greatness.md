description: Harry Potter sorted into Slytherin.

The author insists this one isn't abandoned, but... well, its been years since
she started insisting. I'm inclined to call this one done.

Unfortunately, this one ends in a pretty unsatisfying place. If the author ever
resurrects this, it'd be great to re-read up until the conclusion, but for now
I can't say much about it -- a good chunk of the writing feels like a prequel,
and it got interrupted just as it hit its stride.

There's a good deal of interesting character interactions in this one and some
cool takes on the plotline. The authors choice to have the number of chapters
per year increase as a linear function of the year was an interesting one -- it
certainly pushed the storyline's growth in proportion to "when the interesting
stuff was happening".
