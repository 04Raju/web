description: Unique time-loop fantasy novel.

Interesting time loop story about a wizard. The catch? Its not his time-loop
and he's completely out of his depth. Very well-written story with well-managed
power creep and interesting twists and turns. Disclaimer: still in-progress,
but nearing completion.
