title: Live! in Print - Volume 11, Issue 1
date: 2011-09-14

This year, I joined the team behind Live! in Print, our bi-annual highschool
newspaper. Tired of the old design and the slow release schedule, we've resolved
to completely revamp everything; this year's paper will boast a team of regular
columns, will be releases every two weeks, and will feature more than just the
boring reports on school-sponsored activites of old.

Without further ado, I present: <a href='/resource/lip1.png'>Live! in Print -
Volume 11, Issue 1</a>.
