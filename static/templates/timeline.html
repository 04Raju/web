					<p>This was my first formal job, and it went about as smoothly as you would expect. I was really thrown into the deep-end here: though I'd done some coding and work with computers, I'd never been solely responsible for medical-level network security, large network administration, web development and maintenance, and managing several graphics designers...</p>
					<p>I ended up doing a large amount of network analysis and security work. Before I got there, the network had been a loose collection of various technologies which had been poorly tied together, at best. Afterwards... well, they're called "security standards" for a reason.</p>
					<p>I also spent a good portion of my time maintaining websites -- of which there were several, since CDG was the parent company of several smaller practices -- and designing new ones. This gave me my first taste of management, as well, since the two designers I worked with were tasked with designing the resources I would need for the websites.</p>

					<p>My first term at the University of Waterloo was a big change from high school. The courses I took (<a href='resource?cs137'>CS 137</a>, <a href='resource?ece105'>ECE 105</a>, <a href='resource?ece140'>ECE 140</a>, <a href='resource?math115'>MATH 115</a>, and <a href='resource?math117'>MATH 117</a>) were far more difficult (i.e. I had to pay attention now and again and do some homework once in a while) and the atmosphere was completely different.</p>

				<div id='info'>
					<p>After my first term's impressive change from high school, I knew that I would need to put more effort into studying and paying attention in class in order to do well. So, of course, I decided this would be a good time to sign up for several time-consuming extra-cirriculars.</p>
					<p>I joined the SHADOW program, which matched me with several foreign exchange students in order to help them feel comfortable with their new surroundings. I joined / co-founded an Android app development club and released an app with some of the members of that group (UWHub on the <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cromiumapps.uwhub&hl=en'>Google App Store</a> / <a href='https://github.com/CromiumApps/uwhub'>GitHub</a>), I redesigned the <a href='http://www.agm.essco.ca/'>ESSCO AGM 2013</a> website, and I competed in the Ontario Engineering Competition for debating.</p>
					<p>All of my courses this term were basically version two of the previous term's courses. If you're looking for my course notes, you can find them here: <a href='resource?cs138'>CS 138</a>, <a href='resource?ece106'>ECE 106</a>, <a href='resource?ece124'>ECE 124</a>, <a href='resource?math119'>MATH 119</a>, and <a href='resource?math135'>MATH 135</a></p>

				<div id='title'>Oracle</div>
				<div id='tagline'>Being thrown straight into the deep end.</div>
				<div id='info'>
					<p>My first co-op job experience was incredible: I moved down to Boston to work with a big-name company right across the street from MIT. Basically, I was in Heaven.</p>
					<p>The product I was working on was their <a href='http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/business-analytics/business-intelligence/endeca/overview/index.html'>Endeca Information Discovery</a> system. Basically, it was a system which would push user data (read: Excel spreadsheets) into Oracle databases and then run information discovery on them to determine data trends, groupings, et cetera.</p>
					<p>My first major project was to expand the data input system to include JSON as a data source. Since JSON data and standard databases are fairly different in structure, a lrage part of this task was in determining exactly how the data should be converted. In the end, I wrote a streaming parser (which, for example, could be connected to an auto-updating URL like Twitter's firehouse) which made heavy use of determined flattening (figuring out which key was most important and flattening the data around that) and multi-selection (basically, data structures within other data structures in the Oracle DB).</p>
					<p>I also dealt with increasing the number of useable back-end databases. EID was initially only able to interface with a few pre-selected databases (MySQL 5+, Oracle 11, and SQLite 3, IIRC). By re-configuring the interface between EID and the database connection, I was able to expand this list to include any database which had JDBC drivers.</p>
					<p>I finished the term by writing an installation script for the full EID stack. This was previously a notoriously difficult product to install, but can now be installed and configured for any environment with one click.</p>

					<p>It took a while, but this term I finally figured out how to properly pay attention, study, not have too much on my plate...</p>
					<p>My courses this term finally started to get interesting; this was the first term I didn't have a basic CS course, two intro physics course, and two beginning math courses, and I certainly appreciated the change. Although some of the courses (<b>cough cough Chemistry cough cough</b>) weren't exactly my idea of an improvement...</p>
					<p>If you're looking for my course notes, you can find them here: <a href='resource?cs241'>CS 241</a>, <a href='resource?psych101'>PSYCH 101</a>, <a href='resource?se212'>SE 212</a>, and <a href='resource?stat206'>STAT 206</a>. I didn't take any notes for CHE 102 since it didn't have much content, nor for ECE 222 since I had no clue what the course was actually about (I think it was a... general, catch-all mostly-hardware course?).</p>
