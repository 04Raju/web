            <p>My second co-op job was even better than the first: I'd thought that I would enjoy traveling for co-op more than the alternative, but staying in Waterloo (well, Kitchener) to work for Wriber was definitely more fun than moving down to Boston had been.</p>
            <p>When I joined Wriber, they were in the middle of product development for their flagship product. In a nutshell, they wanted to create a writing coach which would help writers, bloggers, students... basically, anyone that needs to write something. While you type, Wriber provides insights and asks thought-provoking questions, all to help you expand on your work and prevent you from getting stuck (writer's block is their mortal enemy).</p>
            <p>Unlike Oracle, I wasn't given a single (read: specific) task at Wriber. Instead, I took a look at what they had and spent four months making it better in any way possible. Though Wriber was in early stages when I first began working there, I am confident that it is now well on its way to public success.</p>
            <p>The difference between Wriber's code four months ago and as I write this is incredible, and I had a hand in the bulk of those changes, but the major features I worked on were as follows:</p>
            <p>I designed machine learning systems for classifying page clusters (e.g. as relevant or irrelevant), for ranking pages, and for determining which insights would most benefit the user. My work used cutting-edge machine learning and AI algorithms, and was an immense step up from the naive metrics it replaced.</p>
            <p>I also replaced Wriber's grammar preprocessor and question creation systems with completely re-designed implementations. The grammar preprocessor now uses a regex-based recognition algorithm more accurate than any third-party library we could find and chunks sentences in such a way that we can understand the relatinships between various phrases. Using this preprocessor, I rewrote the question generation system to ask questions about individual phrases rather than entire sentences, and to use a semantic engine in order to generate only relevant question types (e.g. when talking about past coops, we might ask 'When exactly did you work at Wriber?').</p>
            <p>Finally, I wrangled with the various modules of the system, both local and third-party, to ensure everything functioned as required. A few cool things I did: rewrote one external library from the ground up, thus decreasing it's runtime speed by at least 5x and rendering it slightly more accurate; redesigned the task system in order to provide multi-threaded functionality as well as just-in-time task interruption; ran analyses on several competing libraries to determine which of them functioned fastest and best; and, implemented a full-fledged test suite (within my first week!) which ran through all layers of the codebase.</p>

            <p>My first co-op job experience was incredible: I moved down to Boston to work with a big-name company right across the street from MIT. Basically, I was in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The product I was working on was their Endeca Information Discovery system. Basically, it was a system which would push user data (read: Excel spreadsheets) into Oracle databases and then run information discovery on them to determine data trends, groupings, et cetera.</p>
            <p>My first major project was to expand the data input system to include JSON as a data source. Since JSON data and standard databases are fairly different in structure, a large part of this task was in determining exactly how the data should be converted. In the end, I wrote a streaming parser (which, for example, could be connected to an auto-updating URL like Twitter's firehouse) which made heavy use of determined flattening (figuring out which key was most important and flattening the data around that) and multi-selection (basically, data structures within other data structures in the Oracle DB).</p>
            <p>I also dealt with increasing the number of useable back-end databases. EID was initially only able to interface with a few pre-selected databases (MySQL 5+, Oracle 11, and SQLite 3, IIRC). By re-configuring the interface between EID and the database connection, I was able to expand this list to include any database which had JDBC drivers.</p>
            <p>I finished the term by writing an installation script for the full EID stack. This was previously a notoriously difficult product to install, but can now be installed and configured for any environment with one click.</p>

            <p>This was my first formal job, and it went about as smoothly as you would expect. I was really thrown into the deep-end here: though I'd done some coding and work with computers, I'd never been solely responsible for medical-level network security, large network administration, web development and maintenance, and managing several graphics designers...</p>
            <p>I ended up doing a large amount of network analysis and security work. Before I got there, the network had been a loose collection of various technologies which had been poorly tied together, at best. Afterwards... well, they're called "security standards" for a reason.</p>
            <p>I also spent a good portion of my time maintaining websites -- of which there were several, since CDG was the parent company of several smaller practices -- and designing new ones. This gave me my first taste of management, as well, since the two designers I worked with were tasked with designing the resources I would need for the websites.</p>

            <p>At some point, I plan to blog about my experiences setting up my home server, as well as managing the deployments of all of my other apps. That'll come later; for now, I'd like to introduce you to J.A.R.V.I.S., or Jarvis for short, a slack-bot which does far too much.</p>
            <p>Jarvis is an app similar to <a href='https://hubot.github.com/'>Hubot</a>. What's the difference? Well... Jarvis is written in Python. That's pretty much it, theoretically every Jarvis plugin could be written as a hubot extension, but then I'd have to write CoffeeScript and... ugh. That said, Hubot was the original inspiration for Jarvis; one of the companies at which I've worked had Hubot set up as an automated deploy-bot and that got me thinking about all the cool things I could do with a similar chat-bot. Shortly thereafter, me and my friends started using <a href='https://slack.com/'>Slack</a> for chatting and the rest is history.</p>
            <p>A bit of background about my house / roommates; we're all programmers and we've been living together for a couple years now. Understandably, our house looks like what you'd expect: we have a couple different sound systems set up, a projector in our basement / home theatre, ethernet wires running literally all across our house, and so on. Don't get me wrong, this is awesome, but the fact that we originally had to manually turn the media centres off and on? Not OK. Clearly something had to be done.</p>
            <p>Enter Jarvis. He's a work in progress, but soon he'll be the interface for our entire house. Feeling like listening to music? Jarvis works as well as Spotify. Want to download a movie? Jarvis will store it on the Stark Industries' Central Database (not really). Maybe you just want to know the weather? Jarvis knows the surf conditions.</p>
            <p>Programmatically, keeping Jarvis simple was important. At startup, he simply scans through his plugins directory and "installs" them. The plugins read in any command we send to Jarvis over Slack, do whatever they need to, and (optionally) write any output back to the channel the command originated from. There's a couple requirements for plugins (they must have an "outputs" list, their entry must be a "process_MESSAGETYPE" function), but -- so long as those couple rules are followed -- everything should "just work".</p>
            <p>Architecturally, Jarvis integrates perfectly with my <a href='https://github.com/TheKevJames/dotfiles'>PuppetFiles</a>, which I use to manage any computer I touch (my laptop, my work computer, my servers, etc). In fact, all you need to do to install jarvis is to run puppet manifest on a node configured to "include slack::jarvis". More about these manifests and how they effectively manage everything will be posted eventually.</p>
            <p><strike>Interfaceially</strike> Of or pertaining to the interface, Jarvis is meant to be straightforward to use. If you tell Jarvis to "describe himself", he should do exactly that. If you tell him that "Jim sent $12 to Bob", he should remember that and make sure Bob knows he's in debt. Clearly, this is a far-reaching goal, but they did it in Iron Man so there should be no reason why I can't do it with Jarvis... right, guys? Guys? ...getting Jarvis to react to natural language is probably a pipe dream; I have nowhere near enough experience with NLP to build that. On that note, though...</p>
            <p>If you want to check out Jarvis or -- hint, hint -- contribute to his skillset, you can find him <a href='https://github.com/TheKevJames/jarvis'>on my Github</a>. As with any and all of my projects, I'm always happy to see contributions. Hope to see you there!</p>
