            <p>My second co-op job was even better than the first: I'd thought that I would enjoy traveling for co-op more than the alternative, but staying in Waterloo (well, Kitchener) to work for Wriber was definitely more fun than moving down to Boston had been.</p>
            <p>When I joined Wriber, they were in the middle of product development for their flagship product. In a nutshell, they wanted to create a writing coach which would help writers, bloggers, students... basically, anyone that needs to write something. While you type, Wriber provides insights and asks thought-provoking questions, all to help you expand on your work and prevent you from getting stuck (writer's block is their mortal enemy).</p>
            <p>Unlike Oracle, I wasn't given a single (read: specific) task at Wriber. Instead, I took a look at what they had and spent four months making it better in any way possible. Though Wriber was in early stages when I first began working there, I am confident that it is now well on its way to public success.</p>
            <p>The difference between Wriber's code four months ago and as I write this is incredible, and I had a hand in the bulk of those changes, but the major features I worked on were as follows:</p>
            <p>I designed machine learning systems for classifying page clusters (e.g. as relevant or irrelevant), for ranking pages, and for determining which insights would most benefit the user. My work used cutting-edge machine learning and AI algorithms, and was an immense step up from the naive metrics it replaced.</p>
            <p>I also replaced Wriber's grammar preprocessor and question creation systems with completely re-designed implementations. The grammar preprocessor now uses a regex-based recognition algorithm more accurate than any third-party library we could find and chunks sentences in such a way that we can understand the relatinships between various phrases. Using this preprocessor, I rewrote the question generation system to ask questions about individual phrases rather than entire sentences, and to use a semantic engine in order to generate only relevant question types (e.g. when talking about past coops, we might ask 'When exactly did you work at Wriber?').</p>
            <p>Finally, I wrangled with the various modules of the system, both local and third-party, to ensure everything functioned as required. A few cool things I did: rewrote one external library from the ground up, thus decreasing it's runtime speed by at least 5x and rendering it slightly more accurate; redesigned the task system in order to provide multi-threaded functionality as well as just-in-time task interruption; ran analyses on several competing libraries to determine which of them functioned fastest and best; and, implemented a full-fledged test suite (within my first week!) which ran through all layers of the codebase.</p>

            <p>My first co-op job experience was incredible: I moved down to Boston to work with a big-name company right across the street from MIT. Basically, I was in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The product I was working on was their Endeca Information Discovery system. Basically, it was a system which would push user data (read: Excel spreadsheets) into Oracle databases and then run information discovery on them to determine data trends, groupings, et cetera.</p>
            <p>My first major project was to expand the data input system to include JSON as a data source. Since JSON data and standard databases are fairly different in structure, a large part of this task was in determining exactly how the data should be converted. In the end, I wrote a streaming parser (which, for example, could be connected to an auto-updating URL like Twitter's firehouse) which made heavy use of determined flattening (figuring out which key was most important and flattening the data around that) and multi-selection (basically, data structures within other data structures in the Oracle DB).</p>
            <p>I also dealt with increasing the number of useable back-end databases. EID was initially only able to interface with a few pre-selected databases (MySQL 5+, Oracle 11, and SQLite 3, IIRC). By re-configuring the interface between EID and the database connection, I was able to expand this list to include any database which had JDBC drivers.</p>
            <p>I finished the term by writing an installation script for the full EID stack. This was previously a notoriously difficult product to install, but can now be installed and configured for any environment with one click.</p>

            <p>This was my first formal job, and it went about as smoothly as you would expect. I was really thrown into the deep-end here: though I'd done some coding and work with computers, I'd never been solely responsible for medical-level network security, large network administration, web development and maintenance, and managing several graphics designers...</p>
            <p>I ended up doing a large amount of network analysis and security work. Before I got there, the network had been a loose collection of various technologies which had been poorly tied together, at best. Afterwards... well, they're called "security standards" for a reason.</p>
            <p>I also spent a good portion of my time maintaining websites -- of which there were several, since CDG was the parent company of several smaller practices -- and designing new ones. This gave me my first taste of management, as well, since the two designers I worked with were tasked with designing the resources I would need for the websites.</p>
