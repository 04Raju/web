				<h1>The Quantum Theory of Politics</h1>
				<p>It's a long-established fact that any <i>"good"</i> politician can change his ideological beliefs as quickly as popular opinion can shift in any direction. For a while, I was alright with this: I could understand the how, if not the why. I could predict the behaviour of politicians, predict their "long-held beliefs" by trending hashtags.</p>
				<p>But lately, my model has broken down. I've had to revise my position. I've had to re-evaluate how politicians work. And I've come to a startling conclusion:</p>
				<p><i>Politics are governed by the same principles as is the universe under quantum field theory.</i></p>
				<p>The basic concepts behind this theory are as follows:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Complementarity</dt>
					<dd>Similarly to light being both a particle and a wave, the average politician is both a conservative and a liberal, depending on the situation. It is not that they are one or the other, it is not that they are one then the other; they are <i>both at the same time</i>.</dd>

					<dt>Entanglement</dt>
					<dd>The act of observing can not be separated from the outcome of that observation. By asking a politician how they feel about an issue, you inevitably affect how they feel about it. More concretely, a politician will feel <i>every possible way</i> about an issue until the moment they are asked about it, at which point the many opinions collapse into the single answer most likely to please the asker. Caveat: there are those who believe that there exist infinitely many political realms, and that any given politician holds a slightly different opinion in each one. This, of course, is absurd, and is only included in this list so as to give equal weight to the opinions of crackpots.</dd>

					<dt>Non-causality</dt>
					<dd>In traditional politics, the <i>cause</i> of getting the most votes leads to the <i>effect</i> of being considered the most electable condidate. Lately, though, we've seen that being considered the most electable candidate actually produces the effect of receiving the most votes.</dd>

					<dt>Probability</dt>
					<dd>A politician's ideals can be expressed only in terms of probability, not certainty. While some opinions are inherently less likely that others, no opinion can be thought of to have zero probability.</dd>

					<dt>Uncertainty</dt>
					<dd>The rules of quantum politics dictate that no entity can ever know both what a politician's current position on an issue is and where that position will be at a future date. This is affectionally called the "principle uncertainty principle".</dd>
