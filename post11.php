				<h1><a href='post11.php'>Common Job Interview Mistakes</a></h1>
			</div>
			<div class='contents'>
				<p>Today, I'm going to annoy you all with my ramblings about what people do wrong in job interviews, and how you can do better. What makes me qualified to discuss this, you ask?</p>
				<p>Well, nothing, really. But I'd like to think I do well at job interviews, and act generally swell when meeting potential employers. I also know how to use Google, and integrated some found data with my own experiences. So, with that, I present to you a list, in rough order, of stupid things you shouldn't be doing.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Making odd eye contact</dt>
					<dd>Why aren't you looking them in the eye? Are you nervous? Are you scared? Are you <i>lying</i>? Wait a minute, now you're staring. Stop that, you're embarassing yourself. They're probably creeped out now. Great your scaring them. No, don't look away, now they're confused...</dd>
					<dd>I'm not quite sure why so many people have a problem with this (many reports show that this is the most common issue, according to employers), but it has a relatively simple fix: read the following few paragraphs.</dd>
					<dd>The key to making strong eye contact is to understand the difference between hard and soft eyes.</dd>
					<dd>Hard eyes are focused, narrowed, or tense. Viewing things with hard eyes sharpens your vision, tightens your focus, and narrows your viewpoint. This is useful in certain scenarios (think studying or playing video games), but extremely detrimental in others.</dd>
					<dd>It's antithesis, soft vision, is the charismatic, wide-focused type of eyes we get when we're relaxed and at peace. Viewing the world through soft eyes increases the emphasis on our peripheral vision, let's us conceive of larger changes at once, and makes us appear more inviting.</dd>
					<dd>When you have soft eyes, you'll appear more charismatic and inviting. People will be less likely to shy away from you, even subconsciously. And, most importantly, having soft eyes will make <i>you</i> more receptive to being in a social situation.</dd>
					<dd>Once you understand soft eyes, there are a few other general rules to follow:
						<ol>
							<li>Make eye contact at all times <b>during introductions</b>. This will set the tone for the rest of the conversation.</li>
							<li>Maintain regular eye contact <b>during conversation</b>. There are no set rules for this, but it should definitely be for more than three-quarters of the conversation. Aim for 80% or so, and adjust accordingly.</li>
							<li>Don't <b>stare</b>. Look away, blink, or whatever, fairly often. Again, no set rules for this one, but one guidelines: more than eight seconds or so, and you're straying into intimate territory.</li>
							<li>For crying out loud, don't <b>look down</b>! Looking down makes you seem dishonest, embarassed, worried, or anxious. When breaking eye contact, look to the side, past the other person, or even upwards.</li>
							<li>Switch your <b>focal point</b> now and again. Change which eye you're looking at throughout the conversation. One of my friends likes to switch between each eye and the listener's mouth (some triangular method he read about somewhere), though I personally think that just seems creepy. Don't, never ever ever, try to look at both eyes at once. It's impossible, and you'll look like an idiot.</li>
							<li>Be <b>languid</b>. Especially when glancing around, quick and choppy eye movements are off-putting. Make smooth, slow motions instead of jerking your eyes to their target.</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>

					<dt>Being an idiot</dt>
					<dd>Alright, I'll admit this one could be worded better, but there really isn't that much better of a way to describe it: if you go into an interview with little or no knowledge about the company, the position you're applying for, or what you'll actually be doing, you, my friend, are an idiot.</dd>

					<dt>Not smiling</dt>
					<dd>You're interviewing for a new job, which (even in the most minor of cases) will change your life for the better (unless you've made an... unusual... decision in chosing which job to apply for)! Smile, goddammit. Besides the obvious stuff (smiles show confidence, people are more likely to trust smiling people, et cetera), it'll make you feel damn good about yourself, which is essential.</dd>

					<dt>Terrible handshake</dt>
					<dd>It's not difficult people. The way some poeple seem to treat it, mastering the handshake is one of the most difficult things one can accomplish. This... is so utterly wrong that I don't even know how to properly insult that belief. With a dry hand, grasp theirs squeeze gently but firmly, and shake up and down once. Don't crush their hand, don't be afraid of breaking it, just... shake hands.</dd>
					<dd>Aside: I almost can't believe I put this one in, but Google says it's somewhat common in interviews and I do know a lot of people who have problems with it outside of them. Come on, people.</dd>

					<dt>Fidgeting</dt>
					<dd>Seriously? You're going to sit in an important, formal interview, and fidget in your seat? Play with your hair? Twiddle your thumbs? *sigh* Act interested! Better yet, <i>be</i> interested. If you aren't interested in what your potential employer has to say, you should probably interview for a different job... after learning to sit still. My God, you're like a five-year-old.</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>Many employers will know within a minute or two whether the rest of the interview will be a waste of their time or now. If you stop acting like a moron, maybe you'll make it to the third minute.</p>
