				<p>I... honestly have no idea why I thought of this. I suppose this is what happens when you spend an entire class (and I mean the full term, not just one day) doing linked lists and BSTs (comprised of linked lists). Throw in morse code, and you have a quick way to decipher it without actually learning anything. Yay for laziness!</p>
				<p>Speaking of laziness, I generated this with an online PHP syntax tree maker. Thus the weird colours. Get over it.
				<p>To use the chart, start at 'start' (duh) and move left for every dash and right for every dot. Complicated, I know, but I'm sure you can figure it out.</p>
