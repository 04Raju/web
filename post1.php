						<p>Well, I've gone and done it again: I got bored of the most recent layout for my website and went with a completely new one, redesigned from scratch. This time, I've gone with a more bloggy-type of website, which should (hopefully!) prompt me to get back into writing regularly. Or, it'll be a complete waste of effort and I'll be uploading a new homepage within the month. We'll see.
						<p>This site was partly inspired by my friend <a href='http://nettek.ca'>Josh's</a> personal homepage, but then, I suppose a horizontal-scrolling website really isn't that unique of an idea. Well... I'll give him credit for it anyway.
						<p>This marks the third(?) version of my personal homepage since I purchased this domain... last month... but I'll choose to describe that as 'constant self-improvement' rather than 'endless indecisiveness'. You can find all of the old versions on my <a href='https://github.com/KevinKarruthers'>GitHub profile</a>, which should be hanging around the top-right corener of this page, assuming I didn't decide to move it by the time you read this.

						<p>So, here's the plan for this website: I'm going to .upload all of the stuff I normally keep on my website (my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, my course notes, my Windows 8-style homepage, amd other miscellaneous useful stuff), and then I'm going to start posting new content. This will (if all goes as planned) pick up once I finish my current school term and head down to Boston to work for the summer. My more useful stuff will find a home in the main navbar and, if I actually find myself being prolific, a search feature may find its way onto this site.
						<p>I've always thought it would be interesting to have a (gasp, dare I say it?) blog, so I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes. I'm going to avoid setting a theme for the posts on this site just yet; I wouldn't want to restrict myself before I've even had a chance to begin... however, you can expect some stuff about: technology (especially coding), music, writing, finances, and other aspects of my daily life. Ooooh, exciting.
						<p>Well, that's it for now: I've rambled on just long enough to make sure I have three columns' worth of text, my magic number for ensuring I didn't screw up somewhere in my site-building. If I'm really lucky, I won't have to spend the next week searching for a missing semi-colon.

						<p>Semi-addendum: looks like I did manage to miss something, but at least it wasn't technically my fault: apparently column-fill isn't yet supported by Chrome. Or any other browser. I haven't decided yet if I'll work around that, or just wait until Chrome has support for it and let a browser-update magically make my site look awesome.
						<p>If you have any suggestions, questions, concerns, et cetera for me, be they about design, content, or something completely different, shoot me a message: my contact information is around here somewhere, and you can feel free to contact me via any of my social profiles, email, carrier pidgeon... whatever.
