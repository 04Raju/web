					<p>In a few days, I'll be moving out of my on-campus residence (with a cafeteria) and be forced to - once again - begin making food for myself. I'm sure many of you are in the same situation, so I'll share some of my cooking tips and recipes to the less culinarily inclined among you...

					<p>I'm currently about one week away from finishing my first year at university. I'm about halfway though my exams, and will soon see whether I made it through my first year.</p>
					<p>The first thing I noticed about university was the exponential rise in difficulty after the first term...</p>

					<p>Since I started my Bachelor's program (Software Engineering at uWaterloo), I've begun to realise that engineers... don't have it easy in university. Engineers in university are not allowed to have lives, mostly because they're too busy doing homework and studying.</p>
					<p>Now, not to say that engineering is the most difficult program...</p>

					<p>I've been told I take good notes. Now, personally, I think that's a gross overstatement, but a million adoring fans can't be wrong (not that I'd know... someone who has a million adoring fans, please let me know if I'm correct).</p>
					<p>Anyway, people probably like my notes mostly because they're written in LaTeX, and are all formatted and pretty. At least, that's probably why <a href='http://clarisseschneider.tumblr.com'>Clarisse</a> likes them...</p>

					<p>Well, I've gone and done it again: I got bored of the most recent layout for my website and went with a completely new one, redesigned from scratch. This time, I've gone with a more bloggy-type of website, which should (hopefully!) prompt me to get back into writing regularly. Or, it'll be a complete...</p>
