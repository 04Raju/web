	<h2>Long Bio</h2>
	<p>Kevin James, born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in June 1994, attended a French Immersion school until grade 6, gaining technical fluency with the language. He began attending St. John's-Ravenscourt school in September 2006, where he stayed until he graduated from high school in June 2012. During this time, he received numerous awards for math and computing competitions, most notably the Cayly, Euler, Fryer, and CCC contests. In his final year of high school, he received a 95th percentile Avogadro score, was 8th place overall in a national physics contest, and received his AP National Scholar with Distinction certificate for his high scores on his AP Exams. He also wrote the ACT, SAT, and several SAT II's, achieving high scores across the board.
	<p>He plays guitar, saxophone, drums, and sings. He has received training on each of these instruments except for the drums, and has performed for groups as large as 500 with each instrument. In his final year of high school, he co-founded a brass band with a large group of students from multiple schools.
	<p>He has been involved with a diverse number of co-cirricular activites: he represented his prestigious private high school as a Student Ambassador for three years, was a member of the school's Creative Writing Club for three years, and later was solely responsible for designing and publishing the school's biweekly student newspaper and annual literary magazine, to both of which he contributed. He was also a member of the school's Youth in Philanthropy group, and was a member of - and later ran - a C++ Programming club.
	<p>He has taken many online and in-person certificate programs, and has been designated an Apple Product Professional and World Bank Institute certified Social Innovator. He has also completed many university-level courses, such as Stanford's Machine Learning course. He is a Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do.
	<p>He has held three formal jobs, though he has done freelance work - mostly in the area of programming small utilities or designing small-to-medium sized websites - for years. His first formal job was as a Technical Solutions Specialist and IT Administrator at Cholakis Dental Group, in 2011. His duties included management of a medium-sized (~50 terminals) system, security analysis, web development, and project management. He then began working at Staples Canada as a Front End Associate, and later in Technical Sales, in the year 2012. His duties there included cash and store management, technical repairs, sales, and technical systems management. He is currently working for BudgetVote; managing a team of designers and coders, and creating a web app for distributed voting.
